PROBLEM STATEMENT:
	
	Buying a product is a great hustle online as there are many options so people tend to take time by comparing 
	different products features and prices.Every time you have to open a product to see its description 
	so it increases the time you send searching for your best option.


SOLUTION:
	
	So I have worked on this issue to minimise the time taken by user to compare different product, in my website 
	user don't really have to open the product to see its description he only has to hover over the product which
	he finds interesting and you would be able to see its description and choose your product which suits you best.
